      <p><i>Under Consideration</i> is a collaborative publishing effort by <a href="http://nazli-ercan.com/" target="_blank">Nazli Ercan</a> and <a href="http://eric.young.li/" target="_blank">Eric Li</a>.</p>
      <p>This project is a container for an exchange of ideas between one another. Each new entry on this site is a response to the previous entry by the other author; it is the next thought of a continuous conversation. In this regard, the entries themselves become the medium in this unending collaborative process. The logo, like its contents, is also subject to continuous updating and revisioning. The two curved lines signify each participant. One is solid, which corresponds to the person who last responded, while the other is dotted, waiting for the other to respond. Once a response is added, the lines flip and the solid becomes dotted while the dotted becomes solid.</p>
